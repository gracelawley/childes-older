## garvey -- this is a mess; will need to fix later
* Child names are under 'speaker_name' instead of 'target_child_name' in raw utterances
    + target child sex and age are also missing ..!
* No speaker information is available in the raw transcripts

## macwhinney -- same issue as garvey of multiple speakers

## weist -- something weird is going on with speaker_name and target_child_name; check later

## cornell -- target_child_sex is missing for some rows; raw transcripts df is missing some info
